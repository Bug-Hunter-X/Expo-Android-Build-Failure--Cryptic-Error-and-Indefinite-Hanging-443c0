# Expo Android Build Failure: Cryptic Error and Indefinite Hanging

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue encountered when building Android APKs using Expo CLI. The build process hangs indefinitely, producing minimal to no helpful error messages. The root cause often lies within the intricacies of the Android build system (Gradle) and its dependency resolution rather than the Expo project's code itself.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have the Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`).
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Attempt to build an Android APK using `expo build:android`.

The build will likely hang indefinitely without clear error indication.

## Potential Solutions (and why they might not work)

Several approaches are commonly suggested online, but often fail due to the indeterminate nature of the underlying issue:

* **Checking dependencies:** While a potential cause, the error offers no specific guidance.  Manually checking `package.json` often yields no clear resolution.
* **Cleaning the project:**  `expo prebuild --clean` might seem helpful, but the core issue resides deeper in the Android build system, beyond what this command directly affects.
* **Invalidating cache:** Similarly, invalidating various caches does not reliably solve the underlying problems within the build system.

## Debugging the Issue

The key to resolving this is carefully examining the logs generated during the build process, or possibly looking at your build logs for your android project. The issue may involve a deep issue within Gradle, mismatched Android versions or conflicting libraries within the Android ecosystem. If this is still a problem, consider creating a new Android project to rule out any local issues.

## Solution (exploratory)

The `expoBugSolution.js` file shows a few steps for attempting to work around this problem. This is often ineffective, so further investigation will be needed.
