This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is cryptic and doesn't pinpoint the exact cause.  It often involves a problem with the Android build process itself, and may not be directly related to your Expo code.  Example error messages may include mentions of Gradle issues or missing dependencies.  The build process hangs indefinitely and provides no specific error.
