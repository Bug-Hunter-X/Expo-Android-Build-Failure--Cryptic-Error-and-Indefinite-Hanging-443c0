// expoBugSolution.js
// This file offers some potential troubleshooting steps, but no guaranteed fix due to the vague nature of the original error.

// 1. Try increasing the heap size for the Gradle daemon:
// Add the following line to your `android/gradle.properties` file:
// org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

// 2. Clean and rebuild the project (this often doesn't resolve the issue, but it's worth a try):
expo prebuild --clean
expo build:android

// 3. Check for network issues during build (rare but possible)

// 4. Check the android project manually. Look into the build files, for any errors.

// 5.  Consider creating a completely new Expo project to rule out any local machine issues.

// 6. If the problem persists, provide complete logs from the build process for further analysis.
